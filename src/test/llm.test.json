      "comment": "Let me analyze this trajectory step by step:\n\n**Goal Understanding:** The user asks \"What's the weather in Seattle?\" - the goal is clearly to obtain current weather information for Seattle.\n\n**Step Analysis:**\n1. The assistant receives the user's query about Seattle's weather\n2. The assistant immediately calls the get_weather tool with the correct parameter (city: \"Seattle\")\n3. The tool returns the weather information: \"It's 75 degrees and sunny in Seattle.\"\n4. The assistant presents this information to the user in a clear, formatted response\n\n**Evaluation against rubric:**\n- **Logical sense:** Yes, the trajectory is completely logical. The assistant recognizes a weather query and uses a weather tool to fulfill it.\n- **Clear progression:** Yes, there's a direct progression from question → tool call → result → formatted answer. Each step follows naturally from the previous one.\n- **Efficiency:** Yes, this is highly efficient. The assistant takes the most direct path: one tool call with the correct parameters, then immediately provides the answer. No unnecessary steps, no backtracking, no redundant calls.\n\nThe trajectory is accurate, efficient, and successfully achieves the goal of providing Seattle's weather information to the user.\n\nThus, the score should be: true."
